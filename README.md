As we all know transit systems are getting crazier day by day and tracking routes can be near impossible. 

That's why our beautiful city has decided to create BusyBus an app that will have real-time GPS tracking for all of the public transit type you use. BusyBus will help people figure out which bus is their's with notifications, plan routes, and notify users of any delays or schedule changes.

BusyBus shows users bus stops within 15 minutes walking radius, (or they can search for one) listing the next three buses that will be arriving at each stop. Once the user taps a stop, they will be shown more information about the stop; it's rating, the next bus to arrive, and a list of all of the buses that stop there. This will include their schedules and any delays or changes. When a user selects a bus, they will be able to see where it is via GPS tracking and choose the time (if not now) that they want to take the bus and when the bus is approaching ( <1 min away) they will get a notification. If they choose a bus that is more then 15 minutes away, they will also get a notification for when to leave their current location to arrive on time. Lastly, when they have reached their stop is coming up, they will get yet another notification so that they don't miss it.
